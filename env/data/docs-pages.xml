  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please make sure you read the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/guidelines/">forum guidelines</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum-user-guide/faq/">Frequently Asked Questions</a> before contributing to WordPress support, both when asking for and giving support, this helps maintain a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for all involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Asking for support</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before posting, make sure it’s&nbsp;about a self hosted WordPress.org site and&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a WordPress.com site&nbsp;(See&nbsp;<a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">WordPress.com vs WordPress.org</a>&nbsp;to be sure).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Post your question in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forums/">appropriate forum</a>, but don’t worry if you’re unsure about which one to use, we’ll help you regardless, and may even move it to the right forum for you if there’s a better place for it. Feel free to make a new topic, even though your issue might appear similar to other topics, most sites are unique and it’s rarely the same issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to check the box for receiving email notifications from replies, this way you know when someone has answered your question, or might be requesting more information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t feel entirely comfortable posting in the international forums, we’ve created a&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/contributing-to-the-wordpress-forums/support-forums-in-your-language/">list of localized forums</a>&nbsp;where you may also get help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you’ve tried some solutions from someone helping you, it’s always a good idea to return to the topic and let people know what worked and what didn’t work, this can also help others in the future who might be searching having the same question you had.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Providing support</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Find an area that interests you and look at what topics have gone unanswered. The&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/no-replies/">list of unanswered topics</a>&nbsp;from across the forums is a great starting point if you’re not quite sure where to begin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a problem interests you, but you don’t already know the answer, view it as a great opportunity to learn along with the user asking, you can share how you research it and help each other learn and grow!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember to check the box for receiving email notifications when someone posts to a topic you participate in. This way you know if the one seeking help has provided feedback (did the issue get resolved, did something else happen and they have new information and so forth).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Reporting security vulnerabilities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It happens that someone discovers a vulnerability in a plugin, theme, or even WordPress it self from time to time. WordPress.org hosts many plugins, and often receive such reports.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you suspect you may have discovered a security vulnerability, please read our page on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">reporting vulnerabilities responsibly</a>, and please do not post them on public forums.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Welcome to the WordPress.org support forums. These forums are available to help you solve problems with WordPress as well as any themes or plugins hosted on the WordPress Directories. We offer these forums for free for all users of WordPress, in the hopes that they can join us in improving the quality of WordPress as a project as well as software.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're new to posting, please read the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum-user-guide/faq/">FAQ</a>&nbsp;first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="user-expectations">User Expectations</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above all, users are expected to be kind, helpful, and respectful. Assume the best of people and try to make things better. Beyond just seeking solutions, users are encouraged to help others. If they know the answer to someone else's question, it is greatly appreciated that they offer assistance. This is by no means mandatory, and no one is compelled to help anyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All users are required to follow moderator instructions. The guidelines below are not all encompassing as that is impossible. Moderators will regularly make requests for users to change behavior that is borderline violations, in order to steer them right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Guideline violations will result in posting access being restricted by first being flagged for moderation. This will require a moderator to approve a user's posts. This restriction is meant to be temporary, and will be lifted when the moderators feel the situation has been resolved. If a user cannot follow the guidelines after that, their account will be blocked from posting. Further actions (such as restricting access to WordPress.org as a whole) can and will be applied if necessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="contacting-the-moderators">Contacting the Moderators</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a post needs moderator attention, there is a 'Report this topic' link on every thread. That will add the post to a queue moderators watch and follow up with many times a day. It can often help if you also add a reply explaining what you need.<br><br>If immediate action is needed, or the situation is not in a specific post, users should come to&nbsp;<a href="http://make.wordpress.org/chat">Slack</a>&nbsp;and post in the&nbsp;<code>#forums</code> channel. (please consult the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forum-user-guide/faq/">FAQ</a> before contacting the moderators)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator {"className":"is-style-wide"} -->
<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide" />
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="warn-about-adult-content">Warn About Adult Content</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some sites contain content that is not suitable for a general audience or for viewing while at work. To avoid creating problems for anyone who is trying to help, please add&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work">NSFW</a>&nbsp;to the topic title of the post, as well as tag the post NSFW, as a warning if a site falls into this category. Err on the side of caution. Some volunteers here work for banks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="do-not-spam">Do not spam</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forums are here for providing users with a venue to get help with problems. In light of this, please refrain from using signatures, new topics, or responses to existing topics as a venue to promote your own plugins, themes or services. Your WordPress.org profile provides you the means to add a link to your own site if you so desire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="do-not-bump-posts">Do Not Bump Posts</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Bumping">bump</a>&nbsp;posts. Bumping a post to “the top” does not help a topic get noticed. The volunteers who try to answer questions look for those without replies first. If someone bumps a post, then it disappears from the ‘No Replies’ view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a list of threads without replies. When a post is bumped, it becomes harder for it to be discovered and reduces the chances of getting appropriate help. Some forum helpers use that list to prioritize over other answered threads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moderators will delete bumps they find. This is in order to help posts get back into the No Replies listing, where they are more likely to get an answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="do-not-offer-to-pay-for-help">Do Not Offer to Pay for Help</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any thread that offers any service for money can be closed at any time. We are not against paid services but these forums are not the right place for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People may seek professional WordPress support from&nbsp;<a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net/">WP Jobs</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="do-not-offer-to-work-for-hire">Do Not Offer to Work For Hire</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given freely, as in beer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net/">WP Jobs</a>&nbsp;board is available for those seeking to find jobs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We believe that people should be able to make a living based on WordPress, but the support forums are not the appropriate place for that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="do-not-post-about-commercial-products">Do Not Post About Commercial Products</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For support of commercial themes or plugins, go to the official support channel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to be good stewards of the WordPress community, and encourage innovation and progress, we feel it’s important to direct people to those official locations. Doing this will provide the developer with the income they need to make WordPress awesome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forum volunteers are also not given access to commercial products, so they would not know why a commercial theme or plugin is not working properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, the vendors are responsible for supporting their commercial product.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are a vendor and observe someone asking questions about your paid plugin or theme, please direct them towards your own support resources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While support of commercial products is not permitted in the forums, reviews are permitted if any of the following is true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>The plugin or theme author upsells on this site.</li><li>The plugin or theme itself links or has an option to upgrade to a commercial or "pro" version.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a developer who is publishing a plugin or theme does that, that becomes part of the user's experience and is a valid subject for a review on this site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="do-not-create-multiple-accounts-sockpuppets">Do Not Create Multiple Accounts (Sockpuppets)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do not create multiple accounts, aka&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_(Internet)">sockpuppets</a>. Sockpuppetry is often used for nefarious reasons, and as such we ask that you simply don’t do it. If a sockpuppet account is identified, it will be&nbsp;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/forum-welcome/#being-mod-watched-or-banned">banned</a>&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If you are plugin or theme developer&nbsp;only</strong>, having separate personal and “business” accounts is acceptable for uploading code to the WordPress repo or for a very limited capacity of support of that plugin or theme. In that limited capacity that may not be consider to be sockpuppetry. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="when-creating-links-to-other-resources">When creating links to other resources</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Public links in plugin or theme support topics may only be posted if they meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The link is to the plugin or theme authors own website.</li><li>The link is to the plugin or theme authors own support website.</li><li>The link is posted by the plugin or theme author them selves to an external resource related to the topic.</li><li>The link is to resources on the WordPress.org website.</li><li>The link is to a reputable image-sharing service for screenshots.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Why is this being enforced?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Links may come and go, websites change, URLs change, this all could mean that someone looking for an answer in the future ends up on a topic that only has links to a website no longer running, or to a site now owned by someone else with different content from what is expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most support related websites have guidelines asking users to post their answers in full, instead of linking to different places, and this is why.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By sharing the information on WordPress.org, you ensure that it is kept available for all WordPress users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="the-bad-stuff">The Bad Stuff...</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need to keep the forums friendly, so, occasionally, topic content will be moderated. In severe cases, users may be blocked. This might mean anything from the light editing of some posts to complete removal of topics and deactivation of accounts. It should really go without saying, but the following are likely candidates for moderation or intervention</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Do not post email addresses, ask others to post their email or solicit contacting people off of the forums.</li><li>Do not post, offer, or ask for login information, even test IDs and test passwords.</li><li>Do not post simply to request feedback on your site.</li><li>Do not use a review for support.</li><li>Do not post another person’s private information (job, gender, living situation, location, etc).</li><li>Do not ask for any kind of access in order to provide support, not even for plugins or themes.</li><li>Do not harass or abuse people. </li><li>Do not contact people outside of WordPress.org for support or to respond to a post/review. This includes using contact forms on their websites, phone numbers, social media, or any other contact method.</li><li>Do not abuse the 'Report this topic' or 'modlook' system.</li><li>Do not post spam and affiliate links, offensive posts, posts without content, or flames.</li><li>Do not recommend specific webhosts, nor post links to webhost recommendation sites.</li><li>Do not post in all caps.</li><li>Do not ask for help regarding premium themes/plugins.</li><li>Avoid asking questions that are more about opinion, like “recommending web hosting providers” or other “discussion topics”, that may lead to pointless wars and/or attract spam replies.</li><li>Do not abuse the <code>@&lt;name&gt;</code> mentions, they are not a tool to get faster responses.</li><li>Do not disregard/ignore direct communication from forum moderators.</li><li>Do not seek legal advice on the forums.</li><li>Do not threaten lawsuits or any other legal action on the forums.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that this list is not exhaustive. Every post is judged on its own merits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s all. Enjoy your stay at the forums! Oh.. And, when you’re done, please mark your topic as “Resolved”. Thanks.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Your WordPress site can be faster, and more secure, and you can make this happen!</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This page will explain why this matters to you, and then how you can fix it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why PHP Matters To You</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PHP is the coding language WordPress is built on, and its version is set at the server-level by your hosting company. Whilst you may be familiar with the importance of <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Updates_Screen">keeping WordPress, and your themes and plugins up-to-date</a>, keeping PHP up-to-date is just as important.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two main benefits to keeping PHP up-to-date:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Your website will be faster</strong> as the latest version of PHP is more efficient. Updating to the latest supported version (7.4 or more) can deliver a huge performance increase; up to 3 or 4x faster for older versions.</li><li><strong>Your website will be more secure</strong>. PHP, like WordPress, is maintained by its community. Because PHP is so popular, it is a target for hackers – but the latest version will have the latest security features. Older versions of PHP <em>do not have this</em>, so updating is essential to keep your WordPress site secure.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then there are a number of secondary benefits:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>A faster WordPress website will be rewarded by search engines</strong>, so you’ll rank higher in search!</li><li><strong>A faster website will retain visitors better</strong> (they’ll leave if it takes too long to load), making your website more effective.</li><li><strong>A more secure website is better protected against hackers</strong>, and the cost and reputational damage associated with a hacked website.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These benefits are good for you, and good for your website’s visitors. These are the reasons you should update PHP today. The next section will show you how to do this.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Before you update your PHP version</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This section starts off with some warnings, but don’t be afraid! As with most things technical, we just need to cover some background before we can get to the part where you update your PHP version.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Updating your PHP version should not be a problem, but we can’t <em>guarantee</em> that it’s not. WordPress itself will work with PHP versions as far back as 5.6 (we’re recommending version 7.4 or more at the time of writing, so this is <em>great</em> backward compatibility!), but we don’t know if your themes or plugins will work. They should, and popular or reputable ones almost certainly will be, but we can’t guarantee it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a couple of steps you should take to mitigate any risk before proceeding:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Make a backup of your website: </strong>a backup will let you revert your site to how it is right now in the event anything goes wrong. There are <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/backup/">plenty of free backup plugins available</a>, so if you don’t have a backup solution already – use one of these. In order to revert this backup, you’ll also need your web host to move your PHP version back to your current version (we’ll cover how to do this later).</li><li><strong>Update WordPress, themes, and plugins: </strong>from your WordPress Dashboard, head to Updates, and then update all. You should do this regularly anyway :) When done, check your site is working as expected.</li><li><strong>Check PHP compatibility: </strong>install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/">PHP Compatibility Checker plugin</a> to check your themes and plugins for possible issues. This plugin isn’t perfect and may miss items or flag false positives, but it does work in most cases.</li><li><strong>Fix any PHP compatibility issues: </strong>if the PHP Compatibility Checker plugin picks up any issues, get in touch with the theme or plugin developer and ask them to investigate. If they can’t or won’t get back to you, have a look for themes or plugins on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> with similar functionality and use one of these instead.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Run through these steps, and you’ll be ready to update the PHP version on your WordPress site – and enjoy all of the benefits that come with this! <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you run into any issues whilst doing this or need help, you should contact a professional web developer, your hosting company, or your theme and plugins authors. All of these will be happy to help here.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can now get on to the final part: actually updating your website’s PHP version.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to update your website’s PHP version for a faster, more secure website</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re now ready to update your website’s PHP version! You’ve done due diligence, got backups, and are in the best possible shape to do the update.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the PHP version is set at the server level by your hosting company, updating involves either interacting with your host’s settings or asking them to do it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, exactly <em>how</em> to do the update depends on your hosting company. We’ve asked hosting companies to submit instructions on how to update your PHP version on their hosting, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md">you’ll find a list of hosts who have instructions available here</a>.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you can’t find your host on this list, and don’t recognize the names of these <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources">system-specific and tool-specific update tutorials</a>, then email your hosting company and ask them to help! Here’s some template text you can use:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:preformatted -->
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Dear Hosting Provider,<br><br>I want my website to be as performant and secure as<br>possible with the latest version of PHP. For the server<br>my WordPress site is hosted on, I want to ensure that<br>is the case. If I am not already on the latest version<br>of PHP, please let me know what steps I need to take<br>to update.<br><br>Thanks!</pre>
<!-- /wp:preformatted -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you run into any issues at this stage, either change the PHP version back yourself, contact your hosting company or a professional web developer. In the unlikely event something goes wrong and you need to restore your backup, contact your host and ask them to restore the previous version of PHP you had running. You can then restore your backup.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You should now have all the information you need to update! Nice work! With an up-to-date version of PHP you’ll enjoy a faster, more secure website and happier visitors.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Faster, more secure WordPress websites for all</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Making sure you have the latest version of PHP ensures your website is as fast, and secure as possible.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You now have all the information you need to update to the latest version of PHP, and you know how to update in the future as well. Look out for more PHP update messages on your WordPress Dashboard going forwards, or keep an eye on your hosting company’s news for more information.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a final reminder: contact your hosting company, a professional web developer, or your theme and/or plugin authors for any additional questions. They’ll all be able to help out with their areas of expertise.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Thanks for making the internet a better place!</strong></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every forums system is managed a little differently. In order to help everyone understand the way we manage WordPress', we ask you please read this FAQ.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#000000"}},"backgroundColor":"pale-cyan-blue","fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="color:#000000">Last Updated: <strong>05 May 2022</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I create an account?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to post or comment in this forum, you first need to have an account at WordPress.org. You can register at&nbsp;<a href="https://login.wordpress.org/register">login.wordpress.org/register</a>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Can I have multiple accounts?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individuals are <strong>not</strong> permitted to have and use more than one account on WordPress.org, in order to maintain accountability for actions and to prevent anonymous abuse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Companies are permitted to have a separate account to own and manage their plugins and/or themes. However in those situations, the account is only intended to be the <strong>owner</strong> of the plugins/themes, and is <strong>not</strong> permitted to use the forums. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Individual user accounts are to be appointed to the various roles used such as contributors, support representatives and similar. Developers who abuse this privilege will have it revoked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please read&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/using-the-forums/">Using the Forums</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/special-user-roles-capabilities/">Special Roles and Capabilities</a>&nbsp;for further details.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I find out if my problem is already solved?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can search the forums for an answer before you post. All of WordPress.org has been indexed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, so if a search directly in the forum doesn’t result in answers, check in Google too (e.g. Google for&nbsp;<code>site:wordpress.org/support widget</code>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the topics you find don’t help you, go ahead and make your own post so you can get individual help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>I have the same problem! Can I just reply to someone else's post with "Me too"?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We'd rather you didn't.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless users have the exact same version of WordPress on the same physical server hosted by the same hosts with the same plugins, theme, and configurations, then the odds are the solution for one user will actually&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;be the same for another. Also it means someone else will get alerts for your problems and debugging, when they don't need it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We ask everyone make a new topic, just for themselves, unless they are&nbsp;<em>absolutely</em>&nbsp;certain the problem is the same (like 'I can't log in to your service via your website!').</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Where should I put my post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forum is organized in sections, with each forum having its own one-line description on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">forum front page</a>. Try to pick the section that makes the most sense and post there. You can start a new topic by clicking the “<strong>Add New »</strong>” button to the right of the section’s title.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please only post once, so the volunteers don't get spread too thin trying to answer you multiple times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To post support questions for specific themes or plugins, visit the WordPress.org directory page for the theme/plugin first (i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly</a>) and click on the support link to create a post. This will make it more visible to the author and making it more clear what the post is about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your site uses the hosted version over at WordPress.<em>com</em> instead of a self-hosted install of WordPress, downloaded from WordPress.org, please post in the&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.com/forums/">forums designated for WordPress.com sites</a>, where you'll be able to receive help regarding your issue. If you're not certain which version your site uses, feel free to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/com-vs-org/">compare the differences</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What do I put in the title of my post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A descriptive title is best, as that will attract people who think they may know the answer right away. Generic titles are much less effective.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Database error creating a new post with Plugin Foobar Active” is a great title. “URGENT HELP PLS!!!” is less so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What do I put in my post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Include details about the hosting environment, WordPress install (plugins, themes, etc.), and the problem being faced when posting a topic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there are errors, copy them exactly, word for word, into the post. It’s best to include the full error than to summarize – sometimes wording is important. If a plugin was activated or a setting changed immediately before the error occurred, mention that and, if possible, exactly what steps were taken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be careful not to leak any privileged information (like your real name or email) if you're not okay with those being public.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Should I link to my site?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you can, yes. When a question relates to a specific site or page, and the site is publicly viewable, a link makes things faster to solve. This will allow people to see the issue and often leads to faster resolutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind,&nbsp;<strong>links will&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;get removed any time later, unless in extreme circumstances.</strong>&nbsp;Google will capture posts, including any available links within minutes, so if that is a concern to you, please don’t link in the body of your post. Instead, include the link in the field for "Link" in the original post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That field will only be shown to logged in users, and Google&nbsp;<em>will not be able to</em> capture it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Can I include screenshots or videos?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, but screenshots and videos&nbsp;<em>cannot</em>&nbsp;be uploaded. They can be linked to from places like <a href="https://snipboard.io/">Snipboard</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do tags work?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same as in your website, tags are ways we use to organize posts to attract the right helpers. They can be used to allow developers keep track of specific features, as well as the volunteer moderators to recognize repeat issues and escalate to core devs if needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means your tags should be chosen wisely and carefully. The tag “REST API” would be a great for a topic about the REST API, while “rest” is common and largely unrelated English word and therefore not a great tag choice. Avoid very general tags, like “WordPress” and “problem” that don't add any value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tags should be separated by commas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I post code examples?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Posting code in the forums can be tricky. In order for it to be formatted properly, the code must be enclosed in backticks (`). To do this, highlight the code in the editor and click on the “code” button. This feature behaves like blockquotes, and there is no need to mark each individual line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a large amount of code needs to be posted, like an entire php, css, or JS file, it should be posted on a service such as&nbsp;<a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>&nbsp;and linked in the post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it's more than 20 lines of code, we recommend you use those services, especially since they have syntax highlighting, which may point out the problem right away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How can I fix typos?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Users can edit a post for up to 60 minutes from the time of submission. After that, the post can only be edited by a moderator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why did a moderator edit my post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moderators will edit posts when it's required. If someone uses vulgarities, posts private information (like emails or passwords), or otherwise violates the guidelines, we will clean up the post. We also may edit a post to fix code samples, or correct a typo that completely changes the meaning of the post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What do I do if I posted in the wrong place or with the wrong account?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Either edit your post or reply to it and explain what was wrong, then use the <strong>report post</strong> button and a moderator will help. Please don't abuse this, and keep in mind that most posts will not be removed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Should I bump my post if no one answers?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum#Bumping">Bumping</a>&nbsp;(moving your own post to the top of the forums) actually makes your post harder to find for the volunteers, since it will look as if someone has already replied and tried to help you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have a whole section for&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/no-replies">'unanswered' posts</a>. If you bump, you remove yourself from that list. The best thing to do is be patient and wait. Remember, this is a volunteer forum!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Should I repost my question if no one answers?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This actually makes it harder for people to help you, and drains the resources of the volunteers. People actively look at un-answered posts to see what needs help. Making multiples means more posts to look at, and less time to help each person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I find my posts?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A list of all posts and replies you've made can be found on you profile:&nbsp;<code>https://wordpress.org/support/users/YOURID/</code></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you're logged in, you can click on the “Howdy, Your Name” link found in the top bar for immediate access.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I mark my post as solved?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's a drop-down on the right side of the post for 'status', which includes options to resolve your post. You can also use the checkboxes at the bottom of the reply form, to reply and mark a post solved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How did someone else mark my post solved?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forum moderators can mark any post resolved. Plugin and theme developers can mark posts resolved in their specific forum areas. They should have replied and explained why. If you think it's not solved, you can just un-resolve it and ask again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Will you delete my post once the problem is solved?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not delete posts except under extreme situations. We feel that leaving your solved post up will be helpful to the next person who has a similar issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you feel you have a pressing need (legal or otherwise) to have a post removed, you can report the post (there's an option on the sidebar) and explain why or come to the <code>#forums</code> channel on <a href="https://chat.wordpress.org">Slack</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep in mind, even if your post is deleted, Google already scraped it and we can't fix that. Don't post anything you're not willing to have in public forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>My post shows up on a search for my domain, will you delete my post or my my link within my post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unless it's a legal or security issue, we do <strong>not</strong> remove links.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rest assured, if your URL is listed in the custom field from your post, only logged in users can see it and it is <strong>not</strong> possible for search engines to scrape it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why was my post closed?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All posts (including reviews) are&nbsp;<em>automatically</em>&nbsp;closed after a certain period of inactivity (currently 6 months). They cannot be reopened after that time, not even by admins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, posts can be closed by a moderator if they've become non-productive to the community. By this we mean if someone's violating the guidelines (using the forums as a blog, arguing about world politics, vulgarity, attacking people, etc), we may close the post to prevent further escalation. We also will close posts that have gone too far off topic to be recovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In those cases, a moderator will normally explain why the post has been closed, and direct people who are still trying to find help in what they can do next.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moderators also often will close "Release notes" for replies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why did a post disappear?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At times, posts are archived in order to hide them from public consumption. We archive posts and reviews that are in violation of the guidelines. Sometimes this is done without apparent warning, as moderators have the ability to reply to closed and archived posts and may have left a reply you cannot see. Also sometimes posts are removed because a user has been warned previously not to do a thing (like make multiple posts) and they did it again. We always delete spam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We try not to delete useful posts, but if there are legal issues, or harassment cases, we may do so to protect the people involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I report abuse or spam in the forums?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can report the post by using the "Report" button found on the sidebar of every forum post. That alerts the moderators that their attention is needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please don't abuse this. It's meant for issues in that post only, not for general personal issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Someone posted lies about me/my plugin/theme. Will you delete/edit the post?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It depends on the situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's a difference between lying and just being wrong about facts. A lie is when someone&nbsp;<em>intentionally</em> says things they know aren't true. Being wrong just means they're mistaken, and that can be solved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If someone's just wrong about debugging a problem and blamed your plugin, that's not a lie. Reply to the post and explain how they're incorrect (nicely!) and try to help them out. It's also not libel nor slander (the latter of which refers to spoken words) to post a review that they had a bad experience with your plugin or theme. That's just someone's experience, and they believe it to be true. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's all about intent. You can't be sure of someone else's, so we urge you to assume good faith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That said, <strong>if </strong>someone's harassing you (or your company) on the forums, do report the post or come by Slack to ask for help. We do not tolerate harassment from anyone, users nor developers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is Slack?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WordPress.org has a chat system via a service called <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack</a>. This organization is free for all WordPress user to join. The&nbsp;<code>#forums</code>&nbsp;channel there is available for anyone to come and post questions about handling questions on the forums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I report harassment?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can either report the post (from the sidebar) or you can come to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack</a> and ask for help in the <code>#forums</code> channel. If you're worried about making a request in public, just come to Slack and ask to speak to a moderator about harassment. We're here for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harassment by anyone is grounds for immediate banishment from WordPress.org. The following situations are examples of harassment:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>making multiple posts/replies to attack a person/company</li><li>making multiple accounts to leave angry reviews/posts regarding a person/company</li><li>following someone to twitter to complain at them</li><li>using a contact form on someone's site to continue contacting them</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not tolerate harassment of anyone, for any reason. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What if someone's causing trouble outside the forums?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We do not have any authority over what people do to each other outside of WordPress.org, <em>however</em> abuse and harassment are not welcome in our community and may result in the abuser being banned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If someone is harassing, bullying, or otherwise abusing people outside of WordPress.org, regarding a matter related to <strong>any</strong> of WordPress.org's services, please let the moderators know in Slack. We will do our best to curtail this behavior immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the matter is regarding a specific plugin or theme, you can contact those teams directly at <code>themes@wordpress.org</code> or <code>plugins@wordpress.org</code> and those team will take appropriate action. This includes harassment from or towards developers. Everyone should be kind to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why are links not allowed in reviews?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reviews are expected be about your experiences with the plugin or theme you are reviewing. Links to your own website are not needed for this, and are in a majority of cases only added by those wanting to promote their own websites (often referred to as spam).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To reduce the overhead of needing to constantly re-check reviews, links and so forth for our volunteers, we made the decision that links should not be used in reviews. If we do notice these, any such link will be removed or the review will be archived, at the discretion of the moderators. If someone repeatedly puts in links in a review, their account will be suspended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Why is asking for/offering email support not permitted?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to keep the forums actually useful for the next person who searches for an answer, it's best to keep all communication in public.  Not everyone can come back and post a followup, and when you take the solutions off the forums, no one else will know what to do when they have the same (or similar) issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asking people to email for support is primarily done to gain access to their site, which is prohibited for security reasons. While most people mean well when they offer this, there's no possible way to be sure that everyone is altruistic. They could be someone waiting to hack a site. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for people who offer to log in, the problem with your offer is that if the person isn't a client with whom you have an explicit contract, and something breaks on their site, <strong>you</strong> become liable for damages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to protect everyone, and to educate people to basic security practices (i.e. never let strangers log into your site), we prohibit asking for emails or offering them in the forums.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Can you delete my account?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The forum moderators cannot, as they have no access to do so. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, users must request removal via the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/data-erasure-request/">Data Erasure Request</a> form. While the process is mostly automated, the Privacy Team is available to assist you should there be issues. Keep in mind, your userid will be 'locked' so it cannot be reused, and you may have issues if you want to create a new account.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you constantly delete and make new accounts, you may be banned for system abuse, as generally people have no need to do that.</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:image {"id":11655960,"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://wordpress.org/support/files/2019/06/about_site-health.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11655960" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WordPress' Site Health feature checks the overall health of your website, and provides information so you can ensure your website gets and then stays healthy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This page has extra information to ensure you're able to use the Site Health feature as effectively as possible, and ensure you are a good citizen of the internet!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What makes for a healthy website?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A healthy website is:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>fully up-to-date (including WordPress itself, your plugins, and your themes)</li><li>runs on the minimum recommended version of PHP and related software</li><li>well maintained</li><li>secure</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to have a healthy website! An unhealthy website is at a higher risk of being targeted by malicious actors. It may also be slower than it could be, and uses more energy to run.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Site Health feature helps ensure your website is healthy by checking all of these items, and giving you a report. If your website fails any of the checks, you'll receive instructions on how to address these.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How do I use the Site Health features?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":11657085,"align":"right"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://wordpress.org/support/files/2019/06/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11657085" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are maintaining a WordPress website, you will find the page on your WordPress Dashboard under <code>Tools &gt; Site Health</code>, where the very first screen will perform a check on your site.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Site Health Check may also include information about configuration errors relating to your plugins and themes, as they are able to use this new module to provide more useful feedback to you, the user.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the checks are completed, you will be presented with either a message letting you know everything is looking good, or a list of critical or recommended improvements and changes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you cannot find the Site Health page, you either need to update your WordPress version (Site Health was added in 5.2) or contact a Site Administrator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Now run the Site Health check!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You're now ready to check your website's health! Head to your WordPress Dashboard to start. You should check your website's health on a regular basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have any problems, use the <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/forums/">WordPress support forum</a>, or contact the relevant provider.</p>

  <title><![CDATA[IRC Guidelines]]></title>
  <link>https://wordpress.org/support/guidelines/irc/</link>
  <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 10:57:34 +0000</pubDate>
  <dc:creator>Clorith</dc:creator>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://wordpress.org/support/?page_id=13981822</guid>
  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The IRC channel guidelines pertain to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/irc-support-channel/">#WordPress IRC channel on Libera</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These guidelines should be seen in connection with the general <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/guidelines/" data-type="page" data-id="9322096">WordPress.org support guidelines</a>, and the <a href="https://libera.chat/guidelines">Libera network-wide guidelines</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We realize that no set of rules is sufficient to handle all possible scenarios. If we did not cover a specific circumstance, please respect our decisions. However, you are encouraged to bring any and all concerns up with an operator of the channel; we will look at each individual case and, if necessary, clarify the issue and/or change our channel guidelines accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Stay on-topic</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>#wordpress is solely a help channel for WordPress. Please stay on topic and limit subjects to those directly pertaining to WordPress. Social chat or other off-topic discussions should be taken to #wordpress-social or other appropriate channel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Ask your question outright and be patient</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask your question and be patient. You do not need permission to ask a question. Just ask your question. There are certain times of the day when people will not be available to help. Repeating your question will not increase the speed with which they return to the keyboard. Also consider that it is possible no one present knows the answer to your question. Please wait at least 15-30 minutes before you repeat a question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Be civil and positive</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be civil and respect other people's opinions, whether you agree or not. Please do not be rude, judgmental or belittling. Respond to incivility with greater civility and respect. Please do not accuse others or request kicks or bans in public, engage in personal attacks, intentionally offend or provoke others. Do not discuss or taunt users who have been removed, kicked, banned, quieted or devoiced. Be positive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Be considerate</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be Considerate. Please do not intentionally annoy or harass users, whether by spamming, trolling, flamebaiting, astroturfing, soapboxing or typing in all caps. Do not run "now playing" scripts. By performing excessive /nick, /join or /parts, you flood all users in the channel with many meaningless lines so please try to avoid it. If an individual user appears to be having connection problems they may be temporarily banned to prevent flooding. IRC presents users with away status notifications; it is unnecessary to publicly announce changes in away status (including sending text to the channel, changing your current nick to nick|away, etc.).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Assume good faith</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>IRC lacks the normal facial expressions and body language used in everyday conversation. Without these it can be easy to misunderstand the intentions of someone and lead to uncomfortable situations. Try to assume good faith and avoid reacting negatively. If you have difficulty suppressing your reactions, please use /ignore until you are calm again, or even indefinitely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Keep the channel family-friendly</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keep the Channel Family-Safe/-Friendly. Please consider that we try to keep #wordpress a 'family-safe' channel. Keep this in mind in your on-channel discussions and when selecting your quit/part messages. Please do not link to anything which could cause offense or be not safe-for-work or use foul, vulgar or profane language (or acronyms or substitutes which imply foul, vulgar or profane language). Please also avoid graphically-violent, racially-charged and sexually-explicit comments. If you are uncertain whether a word is considered foul language, please be safe and do not use it. If you are uncertain, then it is highly likely that it would offend another. There is a distinct difference between how you can act in your own, private channel where everybody knows everyone else and a large, public channel with changing regulars and guests who have lots of different backgrounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>No advertising, job seeking or job advertising</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a technical support channel, and not designed to help you make money, look for employment or employees. Do not advertise your website or ask us how to make money from your website. Do not promote your company or try to recruit users to become your employees. In general if your question or topic involves money, job seeking or offering, or advertising it is not permitted here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Asking for advice on questionable topics</h2>

<p>We will not help you with questions in regards to questionable topics. We reserve the right to determine what is questionable or not. An example of such topics would be SEO practices such as aggregating content and domain cloaking.</p>

<h2>Use pastebin</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please use pastebin for pastes longer than 1 line. There are pastebins available on the web, including&nbsp;<a href="http://wpbin.io/">http://wpbin.io</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/">https://gist.github.com/</a>.</p>

<h2>Be clear and concise and use English whenever possible</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be clear, concise and try to use English. We prefer the vast majority of conversation to be in English. Most of us speak English so it is generally helpful to keep a common language. That said, if someone asks a question in another language and you can speak that language, do not hesitate to assist the person on the channel or in query. Please speak as plainly as possible. Please do not excessively use hard-to-understand acronyms, "txtspk" or "l33tsp33k". Remember that, although most conversations occur in English, many are not speaking their native language.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Do not bring bots into the channel or abuse any channel bots</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please do not abuse the channel's bots or bring bots into the channel. The support channel contains&nbsp;<a href="https://wp-bot.net">WPBot</a>&nbsp;to help with the more common questions and we do not see the need for any further bots. If you would like to bring your bot into the channel, you may make your request to one of the channel operators - be sure to include your rationale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Observe the spirit of the guidelines</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please observe the spirit of the guidelines. While these guidelines attempt to provide a clear guide for the successful and pleasurable use of the channel, they are an outline only. Please don't use any of the ideas listed here to obfuscate or obstruct the intent or to harass other users. The channel is dependent on your willingness for it to succeed. Please avoid the practice of testing every boundary, every guideline, every word to see where you might get away with something. Please do not loudly protest the policies of WordPress and the actions of its staff team in a way that invites drama and negativity and disrupts the regular flow of information in the channel. If you want to talk policy, do it via email.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Respect decisions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Respect decisions. Channel ops work hard to be fair and balanced, but may not always resolve issues exactly the way&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;would. We are always willing to talk with you about any issues you have, but we ask that if you disagree with our actions, to please bring your criticism to us in query. This helps keep the channel on-topic and calm.</p>
